A kanban board is used to track the status and priorities of various subtasks to be done in a software project.  
The following features have been implemented:
  1. A basic kanban board to be used from a command line interface with 3 statuses (To do, In progress, and Done)
  2. Addition and removal of tasks to each, and moving them between statuses
  3. Status fields to the Kanban Board like Maximum entries allowed per column
  4. Multiple boards for different projects 
  5. Priorities and sorting by priority (High, Medium, Low)
